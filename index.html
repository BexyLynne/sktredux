<p>Welcome to StarKickTraders Redux  </p>
<img src="" alt="">
<p>This is a complete remake of the original starkicktraders while not everything
   is 100% the same it is as close as I could get, with a few additions
   like:


<li class = "top" id = "newshit">Choose between Factions</li>
<li class = "newshit" id = "newshit">A new and challenging Ai</li>
<li class = "newshit" id = "newshit">A way bigger universe</li>
<li class = "newshit" id = "newshit">different planets to discover</li>
<li class = "bottom" id = "newshit">New Ships Coming Soon!</li>

<p>If you already have an account</p>
<button class = "loginbutton" id = "loginbutton">Login</button>

<p>If you dont you can always make a new player</p>
<button class = "newplayer" id = "newplayer">NewPLayer</button>
